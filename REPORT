Hopefully this time moodle receives this assignment properly,
and this can make up for the previous problems.



Program can be run writing things such as:

./myStringApp 1000 worst
./myStringApp 128000 first
./myStringApp 16000 best


Where the number is the size of the heap, followed by the alloc mode.
The file to read from has been hardcoded in myStringApp.c file, and can be modified at line 45.

Discussion (Doing this here so you don't have to get lost through the wall of data):

 Whith small heaps and files, the algorithms seem to perform almost identically.
 Best and first fit seem to perform very similary for this exercise.
 Worst fit however does get slightly bigger and more numerous holes as the heapsize and file get bigger, with some data loss.
